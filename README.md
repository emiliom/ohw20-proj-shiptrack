Ship track segmentor:

- Explore Geopandas and MovingPandas
- Your own data welcome!

## Additional Python packages via conda

We can install on the Hub additional packages from conda-forge. Each of us has to run the command on the terminal. For example, for [MovingPandas](https://anitagraser.github.io/movingpandas/): 
```bash
$ conda install -c conda-forge movingpandas
```
Be warned that the installation of that package is a bit slow, but it did install!
